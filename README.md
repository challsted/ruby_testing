Ruby Testing
============

Ruby Code testing and playground

Goals
=====

* The goal of this repo is for me to have a single repo to write small ruby scripts/programs who's only intended purpose is for self learning.
* All code will *eventually* be accompanied with tests, but this requires me to both learn RSpec and Ruby to a much better level then I currently do.
* All code should be fully documented, this includes a README per project (inside the appropriate folder) where it would actually benefit
  * I will probably use the README for small notes to my self until that script/project is complete, while this README will be for the whole of this repo.

Foot Notes
=========
* 1 - Currently only works with a single word, if more then one word is used, it still treats it as a single word
* 2 - Would like to allow for a input file to be passed and convert whole file into Pig Latin also
* 3 - Needs to allow a word to be passed like this "./reverse.rb **string**"
* 4 - This will need to allow for multiple systems to be output, such as DnD 3.5, 5.X or even GRUBS
