Ruby Testing
============

Ruby Code testing and playground

Goals
=====

* The goal of this repo is for me to have a single repo to write small ruby scripts/programs who's only purpose is for self learning.
* All code will eventually be accompanied with tests, but this requires me to both learn RSpec and Ruby to a much better level then I currently do.
* All code should be fully documented with comments, although I have already seen that im probably going over board but I feel its needed for now so I will continue.

* 2 - Need to convert this to allow for more then 1 word
* 3 - Would like to allow for a input file to be passed and convert whole file into PG also
