Ruby Code testing and playground

Currently going though [this](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/) website and completing the chalanges in Ruby (they are intended for Python though). Some of these look to be incredibly hard, others look very easy, im going though them as I can. I plan to write tests for each eventually and to ensure they cover all case I can think of. Such as in the piglatten, it currently only works with 1 word, but has no way of knowing if more then 1 word is given, this needs to be fixed, and eventually upgraded to convert full strings.

The goal of this repo is for me to have a single repo to write small ruby scripts/programs who's only purpose is for self learning.

All code will eventually be accompanied with tests, but this requires me to both learn RSpec and Ruby to a much better level then I currently do.

All code should be fully documented with comments, although I have already seen that im probably going over board but I feel its needed for now so I will continue.
