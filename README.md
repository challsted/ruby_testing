Ruby Testing
===

Ruby Code testing and playground

Goals
===

* The goal of this repo is for me to have a single repo to write small ruby scripts/programs who's only intended purpose is for self learning.
* All code will *eventually* be accompanied with tests, but this requires me to both learn RSpec and Ruby to a much better level then I currently do.
* All code should be fully documented, this includes a README per project (inside the appropriate folder) where it would actually benefit
  * See individual folder for readme with details of what each program is for or what its progress is.
  * This README document is for general tracking of progress, not details
