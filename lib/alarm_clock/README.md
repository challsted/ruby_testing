Link Alarm
===

A small app that functions like an alarm clock, but instead of emmeting a high pitched sound it will load any link you pass to it. Its intended use (although nothing stops it) is to load YouTube videos to wake up to (assuming you have a computer in your room), but can also be used to open a website or a document or open your email at specific times as a reminder.

Notes

1. This project has not yet started

Planned Features
===

1. Look though the YouTube Developers site and see if its possible to do something like './alarm.rb AleStorm' and it load up the first video from the search results of "AleStorm" when the time is hit.

Extras

* [Kanban Board](https://trello.com/b/Q65rSr2s/challsted-video-alarm-clock) I have made a small kanban board to track the pieces of this project along with this README and repo.
