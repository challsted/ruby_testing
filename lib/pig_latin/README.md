Pig Latin Translator
===

A simple program to take input text and "translate" it into [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin)

Notes
===

1. No Tests are currently written for this project

Planned Features
===
1. Allow a plain text document to be passed in and convert to pig latin

Bugs
===
1. Currently accepts any string, and converts the entire string into Pig Latin, so it converts "this is a test" to "his is a testtay" instead of "histay siay aay esttay"
2. Not aware of what a "word" is, so will convert "123" to "231ay" where it should simply leave it alone
