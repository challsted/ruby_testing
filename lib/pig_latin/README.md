Pig Latin Translator
====================

A simple program to take input text and "translate" it into [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin)


Notes
=====

1. [bug] Currently accepts any string, and converts the entire string into Pig Latin, so it converts "this is a test" to "his is a testtay" instead of "histay siay aay esttay"
2. [bug] Not aware of what a "word" is, so will convert "123" to "231ay" where it should simply leave it alone
3. No Tests are currently written for this project
4. [planned feature] Allow a plain text document to be passed in and convert to pig latin
