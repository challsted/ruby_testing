Reverse
===

Very simple "take a word and reverse it" this was my first project in this repo and was by far the simplest.

Notes
===

1. Tests in progress
  * Still learning RSpec and a few bugs need to be worked out in the code before I think i can get it working
2. Running the script then passing it a string will return the reversed results

Lessions Learned
===
1. This is my first time outside of tutorials playing with OOP

Bugs
===
1. Currently does not allow for passing the script a string directly, this is preventing my tests from working at the moment as I dont know how to progress forward yet (need more time)
