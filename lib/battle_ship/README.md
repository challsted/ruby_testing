Battle Ship
===

Play Battle Ship in a terminal!

I plan to extend this to be played with 2 players via the Ruby Bot [Cinch][CinchLink] in [IRC](http://www.irc.org/) but that will be a while from now!

Notes
===

1. This project is not yet started.
2. One person can play both sides of the map (not very fun i know)
3. Two people can fight against in a single terminal each other (need to trust not to look at others side though)
4. I plan to extend this via [Cinch][CinchLink] to allow 2 players/strangers to play over IRC
