Hangman
===

Play hangman in your terminal!

Accepts input from the keyboard

Notes
===

1. Allow user to hit keys on keyboard and game should respond
2. Should read a random word out of a dictionary (not sure how to do this yet)

Planned Features
===
1. Should allow for multiple difficulties
  * Easy would have a few letters already on the screen
2. Maybe a "Suggestion" feature that would cost you 1 "wrong" letter but give you one of the letters of the word
